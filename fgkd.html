    <p style="color: gray; font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="color: gray;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though the build time now is listed at about 5 hours, the original go kart took over 1 year to build, and over 100 hours. This is because many mistakes were made, of which are discussed. <br><br> For example, the one wheel design in the back took over 30 hours to complete. Originally, the go kart yielded a 4 wheel design, however this was highly inefficient as having no differential meant slip was required for turning. <br><br> Over the course of these months, the design has never stopped improving, and potential add-ons are discussed next.

    <p style="color: gray; font-weight: normal;">
      <span style="color: gray;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One update made ever since the design was originally published was a steering system. This system was a replacement of the original steering system that used a very simple lever setup. I still recommend that lever system for any beginners. <br><br>For those interested in the steering system, the steering wheel shaft is connected to a 2x4 that slides underneath the kart. It is the simplest steering system I have seen. Plans on it will be up soon at <a href = "Theo/index.html" style="color: gray";>our design page</a> shortly.
