    <h2> Dow Sheds 3,500+ points YTD, Tech-Heavy Nasdaq 100 Nosedives into Bear Market </h2>
<p>
(This article was written May 7th, 2022) - Equity market indexes are seeing their largest drops since March of 2020. The S&P 500 is in the red 13% YTD, almost neutral YOY. The 10 Year Treasury Yield is currently testing the 3% level, reaching its highest since 2018. The VIX is sitting at 31.2, higher than average. Inflation, and the tightening of monetary policy are behind these weak economic trends.
Inflation has reached its highest level in four decades, hitting 8.5% in March. As the economy started bouncing back from covid, the government stimulus and relatively low interest rates encouraged spending. With this high amount of spending pressure (demand) came the need for more supply, causing prices to shoot up. Commodities such as gas that Russia has previously been a huge supplier of are also suffering high prices, due to sanctions preventing Russia from exporting these commodities to many regions. This is because these sanctions create a lack of supply with the same level of demand causing the commodity to be worth more, costing more.
The tightening of monetary policy is the government combating inflation. The Federal Reserve, or fed for short, discourages spending by raising the federal funds rates. The federal funds rate is the interest banks have to pay to borrow money from each other overnight. This indirectly affects the interest rates on almost all loans. If the interest rates on loans are high, companies are less likely to take them out, decreasing spending (lowering inflation), but also harming companies that take out loans to grow. This is why growth stocks are hit harder by raised interest rates.
Now that we are aware of the current economic state of our country, let’s discuss the future and some of my recommendations.

QQQ gives solid exposure to the nasdaq 100, a tech-focused index. Tech, like growth, has taken a huge hit from the raising of interest rates, and the index is down 22% YTD. Although there is no way of being sure, it is more than likely that after the federal reserve keeps rates high for a few months, inflation will return to acceptable levels, and rates will return to normal. If this is the case, then tech is undervalued right now and has a bright long term future. 
KD is a spinoff of IBM that separated from the parent in fall of 2021. Spinoffs have huge sell pressure in the first months, because the spinoff’s stock is simply given to people who most likely never intended in having it, many selling immediately. KD’s true value is starting to show, up 16% in the past 5 days.
 Lastly, ULCC is my favorite stock right now. ULCC (Frontier), is merging with SAVE (Spirit), creating the 5th largest US airline. Frontier and Spirit are the two largest ultra budget airlines (saving money by operating in secondary markets and underutilized airports) in the U.S, dominating the industry. Now that the two have merged however, they have no major competitors. This allows the new airline to raise ticket prices to nearly the same level as airlines such as JetBlue and Southwest, while still remaining the cheapest option for passengers. This increases profit margins. Despite this merger forcing passengers having to pay more for each new Spirit/Frontier flight, this merger also brings profit to shareholders.
